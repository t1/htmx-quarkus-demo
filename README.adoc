A demo for https://htmx.org/docs/[htmx] using https://github.com/t1/bulma-java[bulma-java].

This is a https://quarkus.io[Quarkus] app; start it with:

[source,bash]
----
mvn quarkus:dev
----

Then press `w` in the cli to open the web page.

You may want to search for `shoe` to find all three shoes from two brands.
Filters are displayed dynamically depending on the search results; you can toggle them on or off.

In the navbar, the login button is replaced with a logout button after a 1s delay and the time is updated via websockets.

== UI-Tests

We use https://playwright.dev[Playwright] for (demo-)testing the UI.
After running the ITs, you can find screenshots in `target/screenshots` and a Playwright test trace zip `target/playwright-trace.zip"`.
To view that file in the Playwright Trace viewer, run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn exec:java --errors -PIT -Dexec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -Dexec.args="show-trace target/playwright-trace.zip"
----
